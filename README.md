------

This is a side project where repo includes source codes for the personal website that will have my bio, blog and ML project implementation. I followed the full-stack path of web development with the help from this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). The current project includes HTML and CSS **codes** ([index.html](https://github.com/aurimas13/Personal-website/blob/main/index.html) & [styles.css](https://github.com/aurimas13/Personal-website/blob/main/css/styles.css) files. Lecture advices had been adjusted to my specific needs. You can also find the always different result of the website [here](https://aurimas13.github.io/Personal-website/). Worked on getting better to develop websites as seen through [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs). As I am happy with the obtained knowledge I seek to finish developing a personal website by Spring 2022.
