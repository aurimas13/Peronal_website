# Project: Personal Website
<p align=center>

This is a side project while repo includes source codes for the personal website (under development) that will have my bio, blog and ML project implementation. I am following the full-stack path for web development with the help from this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). The current project includes HTML and CSS **codes** ([index.html](https://github.com/aurimas13/Personal-website/blob/main/index.html) & [styles.css](https://github.com/aurimas13/Personal-website/blob/main/css/styles.css)) that are updated. Lecture advices are adjusted to my specific needs. You can also find the end result of the website [here](https://aurimas13.github.io/Personal-website/). Currently working more on getting better to develop websites as seen through [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs). Once I am happy with the obtained knowledge I will play more with what I know while developing a personal website.
